# elmocore
Open source RISC-V RV32E core


Elmocore aims to be a fully standard-compliant implementation of RV32E specifications, optimized to minimize hardware footprint. The core is also designed to be readily synthesizable for FPGA designs using commercially available proprietary software, as well as open-source cad tools.
